# Locking in Murmur

## Murmur's threads

Murmur makes use of multiple operating system threads.

Most logic in Murmur happens on the main thread.

Each virtual server in Murmur is represented by the
`Server` class. Most of the `Server` class runs on the
main thread, such as all control channel traffic (TLS).
Murmur's RPC systems usually run on a separate thread --
but all RPC methods are run on the main thread via
`ExecEvent` (see `Server.cpp`/`Server.h`).

The `Server` class is a subclass of `QThread`. The
thread that `Server` runs, is the *voice thread*.
This thread handles incoming UDP packets (ping and
voice), and rebroadcasts them as necessary.
The methods that run on the voice thread are:

- `void Server::run()`
- `void Server::processMsg(ServerUser *u, const char *data, int len)`
- `void Server::sendMessage(ServerUser *u, const char *data, int len, QByteArray &cache, bool force)`
- `bool Server::checkDecrypt(ServerUser *u, const char *encrypt, char *plain, unsigned int len)`

but these methods may call other methods
(such as `ChanACL::hasPermission()`) in order to
do their job.

In general, when speaking about the *voice thread*,
it refers to any code running in the `Server` methods
listed above.

The voice thread methods access various data in the
`Server` class to do their job. Besides being accessed
by the voice thread, this data is also read and written
to by the main thread.

To properly synchronize the access to the data shared
between the two threads, the `Server` class contains
a non-recursive reader-writer lock, `Server->qrwlVoiceThread`. 

This lock provides synchronization between the
main thread and the voice thread. These are the
only two threads that access a `Server`'s data.

The easiest way to understand the locking strategy
and synchronization between the main thread and the
`Server`'s voice thread is by using the concept of
ownership.

## Understanding data ownership in Murmur

A thread owning an object means that it is the only
thread that is allowed to write to that object. To
make changes to it.

Most data in the `Server` class is owned by the main
thread. That means that the main thread is the only
thread that writes/updates those structures.

When processing incoming voice data (and re-
broadcasting that voice data), the `Server`'s voice
thread needs to access various parts of `Server`'s data.

To ensure correct synchronization between the two
threads it is important that the rules for accessing
data in `Server` are clearly documented.

Most of these ownership rules relate to the use of
`Server->qrwlVoiceThread` mentioned earlier. It is
the main reader/writer lock between the voice thread
and the main thread. It is important to know *how*
exactly Murmur uses this lock, because it is not
immediately obvious.

Since the data protected by `Server->qrwlVoiceThread`
is only ever accessed by two threads, Murmur is clever in
the way that it uses the lock.

It uses the ownership rule defined above ("a thread owning
an object means that it is the only thread allowed to write
to that object") to avoid taking locks in some situations.
This is to avoid littering the code with locks, but also to
avoid deadlocks and/or misuse of the non-recursive reader/write
locker.

When reading data in the main thread that Murmur knows is
only ever written to by the main thread (that is, the data
is *owned* by the main thread), Murmur will avoid taking a
read lock on `Server->qrwlVoiceThread`.

However, not all data in `Server` is owned by the main thread.
When data is owned by the voice thread, the same kind of rule
applies. The voice thread will not take a read lock when reading
data that it knows only *it* will write to.

This behavior is not immediately obvious, but it is important
to know for understanding how the `Server->qrwlVoiceThread`
lock is used throughout the code base.

Another important detail to keep in mind is that while the
main thread can avoid locking `Server->qrwlVoiceThread`
during most of its operation, the opposite it true for
the voice thread. Most of the time, when processing incoming
packets, and especially in the
`void Server::processMsg(ServerUser *u, const char *data, int len)`
method, the voice thread holds a read lock `Server->qrwlVoiceThread`.
This is to ensure that the main thread is properly excluded when the
voice thread is reading data, and the voice thread is excluded when
the main thread is writing data.

## Ownership of shared data between multiple threads

This section documents the owners of data in Murmur that is
accessed by multiple threads at once. It documents how one
should synchronize access to that data to avoid introducing
data races in Murmur.

### Data owned by the voice thread

These are never accessed by the main thread, except in `ServerUser`'s constructor.
There is no synchronization on these.

- `ServerUser->sUdpSocket`
- `ServerUser->saiUdpAddress`

### Data owned by the main thread

The rules for accessing these objects are:

- To read from the main thread: No lock is required.
  A read lock is implied because the main thread is the owner.
- To read from the voice thread: The voice thread must hold read lock on qrwlVoiceThread.
- To write from the main thread: The main thread must hold write lock on qrwlVoiceThread.
- To write from the voice thread: Illegal. Disallowed.

The objects are:

- `Server->qhUsers`
- `Server->qhChannels`
- `ServerUser->uiSession`
- `ServerUser->sState`
- `ServerUser->bMute`
- `ServerUser->bSuppress`
- `ServerUser->bSelfMute`
- `ServerUser->bDeaf`
- `ServerUser->bSelfDeaf`
- `ServerUser->ssContext`
- `ServerUser->cChannel`
- `ServerUser->qmTargets`
- `ServerUser->qmWhisperRedirect`
- `Channel->qlUsers`
- `Channel->qhLinks`
- `Channel->qhPermLinks`
- `Channel->qlChannels`
- `Channel->qhGroups`
- `Channel->qlACL`
- `WhisperTarget->qlChannels`
- `WhisperTarget->bLinks`
- `WhisperTarget->bChildren`
- `WhisperTarget->qlSessions`

### Data with shared ownership (main thread and voice thread)

The rules for accessing these objects are:

- To read from the main thread: The main thread must hold a read lock on qrwlVoiceThread.
- To read from the voice thread: The voice thread must hold a read lock on qrwlVoiceThread.
- To write from the main thread: The main thread must hold a write lock on qrwlVoiceThread.
- To write from the voice thread: The voice thread must hold a write lock on qrwlVoiceThread.

The objects with shared ownership are:

- `Server->qhHostUsers`
- `Server->qhPeerUsers`
-  `ServerUser->qmTargetCache`

### Data with no ownership (synchronized via atomic types)

These objects are explicitly synchronized by using atomic types
and need no extra synchronization when read or written to.
The objects are:

- `ServerUser->aiUdpFlag`

### Data with no ownership (synchronized via mutexes)

These objects use their own locking schemes. This is can be
an internal mutex that is automatically taken when the object's
methods are called. It can also be an external mutex that must
be held before accessing the object itself.

- `ServerUser->csCrypt` (Locked via `User->qmCrypt` mutex.)
- `ServerUser->bwr` (Internal locking inside `BandwidthRecord`. All methods can be called without extra synchronization.)
- `Server->acCache` (Locked via `Server->qmCache` mutex.)

### Optional voice diagnostics

`Server->m_voiceDiagnostics` is created before the voice thread starts and is
destroyed after `stopThread()`. Configuration changes require a restart; the
pointer is never replaced while packets are processed. UDP and TCP copy only
value metadata into its bounded queue while the existing user/channel lifetime
locks are held. The queue uses its own mutex with `try_lock` for producers;
failed submissions are counted. The writer never acquires `qrwlVoiceThread` and
never holds the queue mutex during file I/O. Only the writer owns stream state.

`ServerUser->diagnosticConnection` is assigned before publication.
`diagnosticUserName` is written before the authenticated `sState` is published and
then remains immutable. `diagnosticChannelName` is updated on the main thread
under a write lock on `qrwlVoiceThread`; readers hold its read lock. These name
snapshots avoid reading normally editable names concurrently from the voice
thread. Queue records contain no user/channel pointers or borrowed audio spans.

### Optional SimplexController (Funk v0.2)

`m_simplex` and its configuration are immutable for the lifetime of a running
virtual server. The controller/logger are created before the UDP thread starts;
shutdown stops that thread and the expiry timer before destroying them. No
controller or logger exists with `simplex=false`. The original receiver routing
and rate-limit path remain active in that case.

UDP and tunneled TCP enter `processMsg` holding `qrwlVoiceThread` for reading.
`SimplexController::begin` locks its own mutex and returns a move-only
`Transmission` guard. **Keep that guard until every outgoing packet has been
sent or queued.** Releasing the mutex just after the ownership decision would
allow a terminator's successor to overtake the preceding forwarding operation.
The mutex serializes the short routing/send operations across channels, although
ownership is independent per channel. There is no sleep, file I/O or audio codec
work under this mutex. Original per-user bandwidth accounting has its own mutex.

The enabled path only calls `AudioReceiverBuffer::addReceiver` for current
channel members. In particular, it never enters the whisper path that upgrades
the voice read lock to a write lock. Such an upgrade while holding the controller
mutex could deadlock against control-plane invalidation. The normal existing
encoding and send loops are reused with unchanged opaque audio payloads.

Control paths (disconnect, channel change, mute/suppress and ACL suppression)
acquire the voice **write** lock before invalidating the connection's lease.
`clearACLCache` additionally holds this write lock only in enabled mode, before
`qmCache`; both are released before `clearWhisperTargetCache` acquires its own
write lock. Callers must not already hold the non-recursive voice lock. The
main-thread expiry timer acquires only the controller mutex and never accesses
live user/channel objects. The order is voice lock -> optional cache lock ->
controller mutex -> nonblocking log queue attempt. Nothing in the controller or
logger acquires the voice/cache lock in the reverse order.

The controller stores value records keyed by the immutable connection identifier
(shared with PTT diagnostics), not session-reusable user pointers. Names are the
immutable login snapshots. Disconnect removes the record; memory is proportional
to authenticated connections that have sent packets and occupied channels, not
the number of transmissions. Expiry checks the current owner/heartbeat with a
monotonic clock rather than scheduling callbacks against an old lease. The timer
runs every 50 ms; acquisition also checks expiry of the destination channel.

Rejected attempts are latched independently of channel ownership. Advancing
packets continue the rejection even after the channel becomes free. Only a valid
normal-path marker or the configured per-user quiet interval re-arms an attempt.
Out-of-order and duplicate payload frames cannot refresh or release a lease.
A legacy empty terminator at the latest frame number is allowed for an active
attempt. Sequence resets are accepted after the quiet interval. These rules are
conservative inference, not authentication of a physical PTT event. A long
network gap or arbitrary delayed frames after a reset remain ambiguous.

`SimplexLogger` owns a separate background thread. Producers use `try_lock` and a
4096-record queue; rejected submissions are counted. The writer swaps batches
under the queue mutex, then performs JSON serialization, append/flush and rotation
outside it. It never accesses the server or controller. File failure disables
logging only. Counts are summarized per attempt, not logged on every rejected
packet. Diagnostic records can be lost under load; they must not be used as the
source of truth for enforcing ownership.

## UDP transmission scratch buffer

TCP-tunneled audio on the main thread and incoming UDP audio on the voice thread
can both reach the raw UDP `Server::sendMessage` overload. Its reusable ciphertext
buffer is thread-local: a shared vector could be overwritten after the user's
crypto lock is released and before `sendmsg` consumes it. The per-user crypto
lock still protects encryption state; the thread-local buffer separately protects
the lifetime of the outgoing bytes. The concurrent-ingress regression checks
1,024 authenticated packets and their unchanged payloads at one UDP receiver.
